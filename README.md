# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
Anomolies have been discovered in the math and reading scores for Thomas High School. This project compares the original results from our district analysis to the reviesed analysis of Thomas High School to determine if the dishonest reporting from Thomas High School has an impact on the overall district summaries:

* Math and Reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type

## Resources
The following resources were used to analyize the results:
* Data Sources: PyCitySchools_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb
* Original analysis: PyCitySchools.ipynb

### 3 How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect THS peformance relative to other schools
The impact of replacing the 9th grade students' math and reading scored with "NaN" is minimal. It is not enough to invalidate the overall scores of the school or district.
