* Math and Reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending

## Resources
The following resources were used to analyize the results:
* Data Sources: PyCitySchools_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb

### 3 How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect THS peformance relative to other schools
The impact of replacing the 9th grade students' math and reading scored with "NaN" is minimal. It is not enough to invalidate the overall scores of the school or district.
